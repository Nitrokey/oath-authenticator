# Design

The following design choices have been implemented to strike a balance between the secure utilization and
user-friendliness of the Secrets App project. These decisions originated from the [YKOATH] protocol and were compared with
alternative offline solutions. Throughout this process, the aim was to ensure a basic level of safeguarding against
malware threats by incorporating physical user presence confirmation for critical operations.

Other:
- do not allow to overwrite credentials - always require explicit deletion of the credential with the same name
- remove YKOATH protocol compatibility, specifically authentication through challenge-response

Privacy concerns:
- the credential overwrite protection (for the Update and Register commands) can leak information about the presence of a PIN-encrypted credential with the same name. See below ticket for details:
